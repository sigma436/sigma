<h1>Hello i am a new web dev named arkello</h1>
<p>this project is about the person who kickstarted the industrial revolution henry ford
    henry ford was born and raised as a farmboy hating doing chores instead tinkering with stuff his parents while unwilling did give him a place to work on stuff
    then one day henry ford discovered a train driving by and little did he know kickstarted his facination with engines he worked and studied for years becoming a very well respected 
    mechanic who tinkered with machines time to time until one day he got the oppertunity to present infront of edison and he showed his 4 wheeled motorcar design and edison aproved

<h1>after the invention of the model t-50 i think harrison ford rejected
    to move on from his first design and fought with alot of people including his own son
    to keep the t-50 he was also known for not really dealing with stocks and stuff which is why
    at the beginning of him establishing his company he changed partners and companies many times
    creating his finest rivals as well as trying to establish a utopia city for rubber farming 
    in the end even with his accomplishments he almost made his company bankrupt and he was one of 
    hitlers idols with his anti semitism
